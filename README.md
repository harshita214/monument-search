### Monument search engine by Jina

This project is a search engine made by JinaAI specially for monuments, whenever we visit a new place, we either look out for google or we refer a guide but what if we just scan a picture and all information is displayed of that picture describing its history and all information related. Also points like timings, fees etc. to help more.Or if we put a name of monument or place it shows us all info about it.Sounds cool right! Well this is the project main objectie.Currently I am preparing this search engine specially for Jaipur city, will increase its data set in future.


Data set which is used is [this](https://www.kaggle.com/ishikajohari/jaipur-attractions-and-hotels) from Kaggle.
